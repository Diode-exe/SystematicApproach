# About

SystematicApproach is a Chromium based browser (without the Google crap) designed to be as simple as possible. I hereby make a promise to never add any AI or cryptocurrency to this browser, 

as well as any other new things that come up that don't need to be in a browser. 

## Known issues

Clicking a link currently does nothing, depending on the page you are on. Some websites work flawlessly, but others do not work at all, for some reason. 

Otherwise, it's got favorites, back and forth buttons, and refresh. No seperate tabs, yet.
